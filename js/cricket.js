//that solves the following riddle.
//The common field cricket chirps in direct proportion to the current temÂ­perature.
//Adding 40 to the number of times a cricket chirps in a minute, then dividing by 4,
//gives us the temperature (in Fahrenheit degrees).
//Write a program that takes the number of cricket chirps in fifteen seconds as a parameter,
//then outputs the current temperature to the nearest half degree.
